# Van Paint Color Selection
I want to paint the van so that it looks better, and blends with natural colors. 

This page shows some images of vans with colors I use for inspiration:

## The __Something Green Van__

Some sort of olive / army green

## Dark Green Van:

## Mosport Green Corvette
I remember this color from a Corvette toy I had when I was a kid. However, I don't think the van would look good painted in just this color

## Laurel Green Rustoleum Paint Experiment

I sprayed a sample of this color on cardboard, but it is too light

## Agave Green Eastwood Paint

Promising, but I found pictures of cars painted this color and it is too light:

## A Hotwheels Model SeaFoam Green

## Experimenting with Paint Mixes
Mixing quarts of off-the-shelf Rust-Oleum enamel would be an inexpensive solution:
