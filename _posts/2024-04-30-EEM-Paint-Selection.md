## EEM Paint Color Selection
I want to paint the van so that it looks better, and doesn't stick out in off-road camping areas. 

I have spent quite a bit of time deciding on the color it should be. 

Here are some images of vans with colors I use for inspiration, as well as some renditions I created:
